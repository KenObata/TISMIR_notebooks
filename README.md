## Paper title: 
Lyrics Based Music Genre Classification using Transformer models.

## Abstract
Lyrics based music genre classification remains a challenging music information retrieval task due to its limited features. However, with the advancement of transformer models, music genre classification performance has been evolved in recent research papers. This paper comprehensively investigates lyrics based music genre classification task employing statistical machine learning models and recent transformer models, focusing on English songs from Music4All dataset. Our main contribution includes exhaustive comparison between transformer models against statistical machine learning models. The experiment results show transformer models outperform statistical machine learning models in terms of balanced accuracy, even with a smaller and imbalanced lyrics dataset. Also, among transformer models, there is no significant improvement using a model which does not require token length limit.
